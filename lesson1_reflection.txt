Learning how to use GIT
Version control is important, I guess it's time for me to take it more seriously as my program time is growing. 
Picking up typos and figuring out why the new version doesn't work will be a big part of debugging. 
After a successful build is made. 
Commit a new version. 
git log 
git diff [id1] [id2]
Pros: easier to follow since the changes made is logical 
Cons: may need to commit too much or too less.

git log --stat [id]
Tracking multi files make more sense for programmer. 

Easily count how many lines of change are there. 

git checkout [id]
checkout a certain version of the repository

seeing the changes and seeing the program back to work as intended make debug easier
