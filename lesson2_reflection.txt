Git repository 

Staging is the intermidiate state between a working dir and the repositary. 
Staging put files that are useful to be on track while keeping the non-useful one away.

Using staging area, we can change all the things to improve the program and commit each of the files changed one at a time.  

Branches allow different sub version based on one major version. 
In terms of history, since we don't have to roll back and forth, it makes it clear that what have been changed. 

Branch diagram let us to see what is changed starting from where. 

Branch merge is useful for multi-user editing. auto merging is useful when changes are obviously not conflict with each other. For example, A modify a.txt while B modify b.txt. No one touch c.txt. when commit, a and b will both get udpated by GIT automatically. If both A and B modify the same file c.txt, then problem need to be resolved by human.
